_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify positive or negative sentiment](midterm_summary)**_

## Summary of Findings:

### LM vs. ML Sentiment Comparison:
- Both LM and ML sentiment variables around the first return show a weak linear relationship.
- Positive sentiment values for both LM and ML exhibit denser clusters, indicating a stronger relationship with returns.
- Negative sentiment values are more dispersed, suggesting either a weaker impact on returns or a weaker relationship compared to positive sentiment.

### Comparison with Table 3:
- R-Squared values for positive and negative LM sentiments are slightly higher than those in Table 3 from Garcia, Hu, and Roher's paper.
- Possible reasons for differences include variations in data relationships and missing data, leading to potential underfitting of models.

### Contextual Sentiment Analysis:
- Positive Regulatory Sentiment shows a strong relationship with returns, with few outliers and a dense cluster.
- Negative Financial Performance also exhibits a strong relationship, with few outliers and a denser cluster suggesting influence on returns.

### Sign and Magnitude Differences:
- Differences in signs and magnitudes are evident, such as a large negative value with low magnitude in the Negative Financial plot, indicating potential disproportionate influence on return-sentiment relationship.
