## About Me

Hello, 

My name is Ryan Thomas, and I am a graduate of Lehigh University. I majored in finance with a minor in computer science. Throughout my time at Lehigh, I gained unique skills within these two fields of study and have a profound desire to enhance these skills throughout my career. When I am not spending my time working, I like to enjoy the outdoors by fishing and running. Additionally, I like to weightlift and play baseball.

_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify positive or negative sentiment](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/asgn-05-ryant382)**_

## Summary of Findings:

### LM vs. ML Sentiment Comparison:
- Both LM and ML sentiment variables around the first return show a weak linear relationship.
- Positive sentiment values for both LM and ML exhibit denser clusters, indicating a stronger relationship with returns.
- Negative sentiment values are more dispersed, suggesting either a weaker impact on returns or a weaker relationship compared to positive sentiment.

### Comparison with Table 3:
- R-Squared values for positive and negative LM sentiments are slightly higher than those in Table 3 from Garcia, Hu, and Roher's paper.
- Possible reasons for differences include variations in data relationships and missing data, leading to potential underfitting of models.

### Contextual Sentiment Analysis:
- Positive Regulatory Sentiment shows a strong relationship with returns, with few outliers and a dense cluster.
- Negative Financial Performance also exhibits a strong relationship, with few outliers and a denser cluster suggesting influence on returns.

### Sign and Magnitude Differences:
- Differences in signs and magnitudes are evident, such as a large negative value with low magnitude in the Negative Financial plot, indicating potential disproportionate influence on return-sentiment relationship.

## Career Objectives

Upon my graduation from Lehigh University, I will be joining BNY Mellon as a Market and Wealth Services. I will be a part of a two-year rotational analyst program where I will work in fields relating to Equity Trading, Credit Management, Real Estate, Treasury Services, and many more. Within my career I hope to continue to utilize the crossover between finance and computer science.

## Hobbies

Maybe include a little about these, especially if they are the kinds of things that work well in interviews.
